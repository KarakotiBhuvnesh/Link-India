      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <p>To generate evidence-based insights and policy recommendations that advance economic cooperation.</p>
      <p>We do this by producing policy briefs, white papers, and reports on UK–India trade, investment, migration, education, and cultural diplomacy. We disseminate this through policy roundtables with government officials, business leaders, academics, and civil society.</p>
      <p>We aim to organize UK–India strategic forums focused on sectors like tech, education and sustainability. We are keen on building a UK–India Young Policy Leaders Network to engage emerging thinkers. Finally, we will convene diaspora town halls or stakeholder consultations for policy feedback.</p>
